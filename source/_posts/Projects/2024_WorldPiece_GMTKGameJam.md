## Background

As the shadow of war engulfs Europe, the Führer's ambition for domination grows boundless. The Empire is locked in a fierce battle, where every decision could tip the scales between victory and annihilation. In these dark times, the Führer has summoned you—one of the Empire’s most brilliant weapons engineers. Your mission is to craft the deadliest missiles with unparalleled precision, capable of obliterating enemy cities with minimal resources.

But this is no ordinary task. The Empire’s resources are rapidly dwindling, and the Führer demands nothing less than perfection. He has entrusted you with the power to alter the course of history, but any misstep could mean the end of everything.

The fate of the Empire—and your own survival—rests in your hands.

## Brief

In this game, you'll play the role of a scientist who creates a nuclear bomb and decides to launch it. You'll have to create the bomb with the least amount of resources and launch it according to the Führer's orders. 

You will use basic shapes such as triangles, squares, overlays, rotations, scaling and other effects to create shapes that correspond to the bombing zones given by the Führer.

Then you press the launch button, and the fate of all men is in your hands. 

## Rules

Players can input the basic shape and other components to modify the shape.

The right-hand slot performs an in-computation on the left-hand computation result. The rightmost slot outputs the final result.

Please use each component to create the same shape as the required blast zone.
